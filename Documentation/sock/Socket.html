            Sockets can be plain or managed by the Socket class.
            If managed thread-safe recv/send functions can be used.<br/>
            - upon calling Socket::close, other threads using recv/send will shortly stop doing so and throw an error so that the socket can close<br/>
            - in addition to this future recv/send calls with throw an error</p>
